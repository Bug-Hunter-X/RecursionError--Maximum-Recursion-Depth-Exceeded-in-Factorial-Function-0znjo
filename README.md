# RecursionError in Python Factorial Function
This example demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: exceeding the maximum recursion depth.  The `factorial` function lacks proper handling for negative input, leading to infinite recursion.

The solution demonstrates how to add a base case to handle negative input gracefully.
